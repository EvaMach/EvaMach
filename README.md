### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a frontend developer on a quest to create user-centered, intuitive interfaces that arenâ€™t just pretty on the outside but follow clean code principles and best practices. Constantly leveling up and exploring the wonderful world of programming. ðŸš€ Not much to see here, as I do most of my coding for [@newtontechnologies](https://github.com/newtontechnologies).ðŸ”’

To checkout some of my work there and read about what I do, visit [my website](https://eva-machova.cz/). ðŸ˜Š
