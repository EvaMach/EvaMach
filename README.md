### Hi there 👋

I’m a frontend developer with background in testing and UX/UI design, passionate about creating user-centered and intuitive interfaces that are optimized and bug-free. 🐛

React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Ant Design, and CSS are my daily companions. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Python, Flask, Cypress, and Next.js cross my path less often, but I enjoy working with them just as much. I love learning and sharing my passion with others through lecturing and mentoring. ✨
